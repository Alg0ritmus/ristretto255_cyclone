/**
  * This file represents an excerpt of code from the cryptographic
  * library Cyclone. None of this code has been edited;
  * the only change from the original code is the renaming of 
  * functions that we extracted. You can see the original naming 
  * as well as the URL to the function implementation above each
  * function. We chose the Cyclone crypto library because of its
  * advantages, such as compactness and speed, eliminating 
  * the need for I/O conversion. In other words, we do not need to
  * perform any conversion, such as pack/unpack or 
  * from_bytes/to_bytes, as required by other libraries like 
  * TweetNaCl or MonoCypher. Results from our speed measurements
  * have shown that Cyclone is approximately 5 times faster than
  * TweetNaCl (packing/unpacking not included).
  * Additionally, while MonoCypher is slightly faster (about 1.5x)
  * than Cyclone, there are highly efficient implementations written
  * in assembly language that outperform any C implementations. These
  * are particularly suitable for embedded  MCUs like the ARM 
  * Cortex-M4. Note that measurements were performed on a STM32 MCU
  * with a Cortex-M4 core.
  *
  * We also appreciate the maintenance of the Cyclone library, so we
  * are using the latest version, 2.3.0, released on June 12, 2023.
